      <h3>Generative AI</h3>
      <p>We study <strong>text-to-image</strong>, <strong>video</strong>, and <strong>3D generation</strong> with a focus on diffusion models, controllable generation, and efficiency.</p>

      <h4>1. Controllable &amp; Training-free Generation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Generating images from text or sketches without retraining</li>
        <li>Providing fine-grained control over content and style</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2. Efficient Diffusion Models</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Reducing computation and memory requirements</li>
        <li>Applying quantization and compression for faster generation</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>3. 3D Generation &amp; Editing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating and editing 3D content from text or images</li>
        <li>Preserving object identity while enabling shape and texture changes</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Computer Vision under Real-World Constraints</h3>
      <p>We design robust vision algorithms for challenging environments or limited data scenarios, with applications in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomous driving</strong> (e.g., LiDAR semantic segmentation in adverse weather)</li>
        <li><strong>Open-vocabulary segmentation</strong> for recognizing unseen object categories</li>
        <li><strong>Weakly/unsupervised learning</strong> for data-scarce domains</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient training</strong> methods such as dataset distillation and token pruning</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="about-card">
      <h3>Trustworthy AI</h3>
      <p>We investigate and mitigate AI flaws by creating frameworks to evaluate and prevent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hallucinations</strong> in generative models through detection and grounding techniques</li>
        <li><strong>Bias</strong> in AI systems via fairness-aware training and evaluation protocols</li>
      </ul>
