# <i class="fas fa-flask"></i> About

Welcome to the Computer Vision and Machine Learning (CVML) Lab at KAIST!  
We are a team of passionate researchers developing **robust**, **efficient**, and **trustworthy** machine learning models to address real-world challenges.

## Research Interests

### Generative AI
We study **text-to-image**, **video**, and **3D generation** with a focus on diffusion models, controllable generation, and efficiency.

#### 1. Controllable & Training-free Generation
- Generating images from text or sketches without retraining  
- Providing fine-grained control over content and style

#### 2. Efficient Diffusion Models
- Reducing computation and memory requirements  
- Applying quantization and compression for faster generation

#### 3. 3D Generation & Editing
- Creating and editing 3D content from text or images  
- Preserving object identity while enabling shape and texture changes

### Computer Vision under Real-World Constraints
We design robust vision algorithms for challenging environments or limited data scenarios, with applications in:
- **Autonomous driving** (e.g., LiDAR semantic segmentation in adverse weather)  
- **Open-vocabulary segmentation** for recognizing unseen object categories  
- **Weakly/unsupervised learning** for data-scarce domains  
- **Efficient training** methods such as dataset distillation and token pruning

---

### Trustworthy AI
We investigate and mitigate AI flaws by creating frameworks to evaluate and prevent:
- **Hallucinations** in generative models through detection and grounding techniques  
- **Bias** in AI systems via fairness-aware training and evaluation protocols

Our work is regularly presented at top-tier conferences such as **CVPR**, **NeurIPS**, **ICLR**, **ECCV**, **ACL**, and **AAAI**, and we maintain a collaborative, supportive research environment.
