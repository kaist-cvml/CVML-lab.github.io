Welcome to the Computer Vision and Machine Learning (CVML) Lab at KAIST!  
We are a team of passionate researchers developing **robust**, **efficient**, and **trustworthy** machine learning models to address real-world challenges.


## Research Interests

### Generative AI
We develop high-fidelity text-to-image, video, and 3D generation methods, focusing on **diffusion models** and **user-guided control**.

### Computer Vision under Real-World Constraints
We design robust vision algorithms for challenging environments or limited data scenarios, with applications in:
- **Autonomous driving** (e.g., LiDAR semantic segmentation)  
- **Open-vocabulary segmentation**  
- **Weakly/unsupervised learning**  
- **Efficient training** (e.g., dataset distillation)

### Trustworthy AI
We investigate and mitigate AI flaws by creating frameworks to evaluate and prevent:
- Hallucinations in generative models  
- Bias in AI systems
