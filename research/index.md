# <i class="fas fa-flask"></i> About

Welcome to the Computer Vision and Machine Learning (CVML) Lab at KAIST!  
We are a team of passionate researchers developing **robust**, **efficient**, and **trustworthy** machine learning models to address real-world challenges.

## Research Interests

### Generative AI
We explore advanced **text-to-image**, **video**, and **3D generation** techniques with a strong focus on diffusion models, controllable generation, and efficiency.

#### 1. Controllable & Training-free Text-to-Image Generation
- Developing methods to generate images from text or sketches without retraining the model  
- Enabling fine-grained user control over the generation process

#### 2. Efficient & Memory-Aware Diffusion Models
- Reducing computation and memory usage in diffusion-based generative models  
- Designing quantization and model compression strategies for high-speed generation

#### 3. 3D Generation and Editing
- Creating 3D content directly from text or images  
- Providing editing controls for shape, texture, and style while preserving object identity

#### 4. Hallucination Mitigation in Generative Models
- Detecting and preventing hallucinated or factually incorrect outputs in generated images  
- Leveraging external knowledge or retrieval-based grounding to improve realism and reliability

### Computer Vision under Real-World Constraints
We design robust vision algorithms for challenging environments or limited data scenarios, with applications in:
- **Autonomous driving** (e.g., LiDAR semantic segmentation in adverse weather)  
- **Open-vocabulary segmentation** for recognizing unseen object categories  
- **Weakly/unsupervised learning** for data-scarce domains  
- **Efficient training** methods such as dataset distillation and token pruning

---

### Trustworthy AI
We investigate and mitigate AI flaws by creating frameworks to evaluate and prevent:
- **Hallucinations** in generative models through detection and grounding techniques  
- **Bias** in AI systems via fairness-aware training and evaluation protocols

Our work is regularly presented at top-tier conferences such as **CVPR**, **NeurIPS**, **ICLR**, **ECCV**, **ACL**, and **AAAI**, and we maintain a collaborative, supportive research environment.
