Welcome to the Computer Vision and Machine Learning (CVML) Lab at KAIST! We are a passionate group of researchers dedicated to developing robust, efficient, and trustworthy machine learning models that solve real-world challenges.

Here are some of the exciting areas we're currently exploring:

Generative AI: We are pioneering new methods for high-fidelity text-to-image, video, and 3D generation. Our research focuses on diffusion models and user-guided control.

Computer Vision under Real-World Constraints: Our lab tackles general computer vision tasks in challenging environments or with limited data. This includes developing robust techniques for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, with a focus on LiDAR semantic segmentation. We also advance foundational ML concepts through research in open-vocabulary segmentation, weakly/unsupervised learning, and efficient training methods such as dataset distillation.

Trustworthy AI: We lead efforts to understand and mitigate AI flaws. This includes developing novel frameworks to evaluate and prevent issues like hallucination and bias in generative models.

The impact of our work is consistently recognized at the world's premier AI conferences, including CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ECCV, ACL, and AAAI. We are committed to advancing the science of AI and fostering a highly collaborative and supportive research environment.
